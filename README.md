#VINCULATE

In the current context, organizations face a growing demand for services and resources, which increases the need to connect with potential volunteers and donors. Additionally, they encounter potential weaknesses and threats such as resource constraints, competition with other organizations, and the need to enhance their visibility in the community.
This project aims to connect non-governmental, civil, and non-profit organizations with volunteers and donors. It will primarily target small and medium-sized organizations that need to publicize events and effectively communicate their needs.
Thus, the project will operate within the realm of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and provide an online platform to facilitate collaboration among organizations, volunteers, and donors. The system users will include organizations that need to publish events and communicate their needs, as well as potential volunteers and donors seeking to engage in charitable activities.
